The pressure ratio is defined as:
$$
\Pi=p_1/p_2>p_1
$$

The isentropic efficiency as a function of the polytropic efficiency is given by
$$
\eta_s = \frac{1 - \Pi^{\frac{\eta_p (\gamma - 1)}{\gamma}}}{1 - \Pi^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}}
$$

The polytropic efficiency as a function of the isentropic efficiency is given by
$$
\eta_p = \left( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \right) \frac{  \ln\left( {1 - \eta_s \left(1 - \Pi^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}} \right)} \right)}{\ln(\Pi)}
$$

The entropy generation as a function of polytropic efficiency and pressure ratio is given by
$$
s_{\mathrm{gen}} / R = (1 - \eta_p) \cdot \ln(\Pi)
