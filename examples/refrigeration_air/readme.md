This example is representative of a refrigeration gas Brayton cycle.
Prescribing the effectiveness of the recuperator does not seem to work well in this cycle configuration.
By contrast, prescribing the enthalpy at the inlet of the hot or cold sides of the recuperator seems to work quite well.
Giving a good initial guess for the enthalpy is not as obvious as for the recuperator effectiveness, but it is not difficult using the functionality to plot the cycle in real time.
