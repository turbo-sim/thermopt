 abstract = {The cumulative global capacity of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems for the conversion of renewable and waste thermal energy is undergoing a rapid growth and is estimated to be approx. 2000 MWe considering only installations that went into operation after 1995. The potential for the conversion of the thermal power coming from liquid-dominated geothermal reservoirs, waste heat from primary engines or industrial processes, biomass combustion, and concentrated solar radiation into electricity is arguably enormous. ORC technology is possibly the most flexible in terms of capacity and temperature level and is currently often the only applicable technology for the conversion of external thermal energy sources. In addition, ORC power systems are suitable for the cogeneration of heating and/or cooling, another advantage in the framework of distributed power generation. Related research and development is therefore very lively. These considerations motivated the effort documented in this article, aimed at providing consistent information about the evolution, state, and future of this power conversion technology. First, basic theoretical elements on the thermodynamic cycle, working fluid, and design aspects are illustrated, together with an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages in comparison to competing technologies. An overview of the long history of the development of ORC power systems follows, in order to place the more recent evolution into perspective. Then, a compendium of the many aspects of the state of the art is illustrated: the solutions currently adopted in commercial plants and the main-stream applications, including information about exemplary installations. A classification and terminology for ORC power plants are proposed. An outlook on the many research and development activities is provided, whereby information on new high-impact applications, such as automotive heat recovery is included. Possible directions of future developments are highlighted, ranging from efforts targeting volume-produced stationary and mobile mini-ORC systems with a power output of few kWe, up to large MWe base-load ORC plants.},

For many years the design of a modern turbine or compressor has been unthinkable without the help of CFD and this dependence has increased as more of the ﬂow becomes amenable to numerical prediction. The beneﬁts of CFD range from shorter design cycles to better performance and reduced costs and weight. This paper presents a review of the main CFD methods in use, discusses their advantages and limitations and points out where further developments are required. The paper is concerned with the application of CFD and does not describe the numerical methods or turbulence modelling in any detail.},

 abstract = {A comparison of optimized trilateral cycle (TLC) - systems with water as working fluid and optimized organic Rankine cycle (ORC) – systems with pure organic working fluids is presented. The study includes the heat transfer to and from the cycles. The TLC - systems were optimized by the selection of the maximum water temperature, the ORC - systems by the selection of the working fluid and the process parameters. The optimization criterion is the exergy efficiency for power production being the ratio of the net power output to the incoming exergy flow of the heat carrier. Results will be presented for five different cases specified by the inlet temperature of the heat carrier and the inlet temperature of the cooling agent. The inlet temperature pairs are (350 °C, 62 °C), (280 °C, 62 °C), (280 °C, 15 °C), (220 °C, 15 °C) and (150 °C, 15 °C). It is found that the exergy efficiency for power production is larger by 14\%–29\% for the TLC than for the ORC. On the other hand, the outgoing volume flows from the expander are larger for the TLC than for the ORC by a factor ranging from 2.8 for the first case to 70 for the last case.},

 abstract = {This paper deals with handling of the cubic equation of state (CEOS) in equation-oriented (EO) process optimization. The roots of the CEOS are generally computed by subroutine-based calculations that involve logical if-else conditions. This approach can lead to nonsmoothness and convergence issues when used with gradient-based solvers in an EO framework. In this work, we propose a new general EO approach for selecting the appropriate root of the CEOS by incorporating derivative constraints specific to the desired (vapor or liquid) phase. We prove that these constraints are capable of isolating the liquid, middle and vapor root. The derivative constraints are tested using the EO phase-equilibrium formulation of Gopal and Biegler (1999) which is suitably extended for handling CEOS and relaxing the derivative constraints in the event of disappearance of phases. Using numerical examples involving simulation of flash vessels and optimization of distillation column, it is demonstrated that the proposed EO formulation always selects the appropriate roots, handles missing phases on distillation trays and flash units, and is fairly robust to different starting points in the phase envelopes.},

 abstract = {Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) has been widely used for the recovery of low-grade heat into power such as solar energy and industrial waste heat. The overall thermal efficiency of ORC is affected by large exergy destruction in the evaporator due to the temperature mismatching between the heat source and working fluid. Trilateral Cycle (TLC) and Organic Flash Cycle (OFC) have been recognized as potential solutions because of their better performance on temperature matching between the heat source and working fluid at the evaporator. In this study, thermodynamic models of above three cycles are established in MATLAB/REFPROP. Results indicate that TLC obtains the largest net power output, thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of 13.6 kW, 14.8\% and 40.8\% respectively at the evaporation temperature of 152℃, which is 37\% higher than that of BORC (9.9 kW) and 58\% higher than that of OFC (8.6 kW). BORC is more suitable under the conditions low evaporation temperature is relatively low due to the achieved maximum net power output, thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency. OFC has the minimum net power output, thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency under all the conditions of evaporation temperature compared to TLC and BORC. As for the UA value, TLC has the largest one ranging from 7.9 kW/℃ to 8.8 kW/℃ under all conditions while OFC gains the minimum UA value at low evaporation temperature and BORC gains the minimum UA value at high evaporation temperature.},

It is argued that most processes and operations of industrial interest have combined discrete and continuous characteristics. Furthermore, effective tools for describing both the physical behaviour of process systems, and the external control actions and disturbances imposed on them are required. In both areas, major concerns include managing the complexity of real processes, and supporting the development of general components that can be re-used within a number of different applications. Recent work in this direction is reviewed. A general mathematical statement for the combined discrete and continuous dynamic simulation problem is presented, and the use of symbolic, structural and numerical solution techniques is discussed. Methods for the diagnosis of problems that are either badly-posed or difficult to solve with currently available methods are also considered. The areas of modelling distributed parameter systems, and supporting the formal description and solution of general optimisation problems are identified as being of strategic importance for the future evolution of general-purpose process modelling environments.},

 abstract = {A new formulation for the thermodynamic properties of nitrogen has been developed. Many new data sets have become available, including high accuracy data from single and dual-sinker apparatuses which improve the accuracy of the representation of the pρT surface of gaseous, liquid, and supercritical nitrogen, including the saturation states. New measurements of the speed of sound from spherical resonators yield accurate information on caloric properties in gaseous and supercritical nitrogen. Isochoric heat capacity and enthalpy data have also been published. Sophisticated procedures for the optimization of the mathematical structure of equations of state and special functional forms for an improved representation of data in the critical region were used. Constraints regarding the structure of the equation ensure reasonable results up to extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. For calibration applications, the new reference equation is supplemented by a simple but also accurate formulation, valid only for supercritical nitrogen between 250 and 350 K at pressures up to 30 MPa. The uncertainty in density of the new reference equation of state ranges from 0.02\% at pressures less than 30 MPa up to 0.6\% at very high pressures, except in the range from 270 to 350 K at pressures less than 12 MPa where the uncertainty in density is 0.01\%. The equation is valid from the triple point temperature to temperatures of 1000 K and up to pressures of 2200 MPa. From 1000 to 1800 K, the equation was validated with data of limited accuracy. The extrapolation behavior beyond 1800 K is reasonable up to the limits of chemical stability of nitrogen, as indicated by comparison to experimental shock tube data.},

@article{ziaja_numerical_2021,
 abstract = {The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) represents an emerging technology aimed at exploiting lower temperature heat sources, such as waste heat in industrial processes or exhaust heat in combustion engines. One key aspect of this technology is the efficient and economical operation at part load, typically realized by a partial admission control, which is challenging to predict numerically. Full-annulus computation can only be avoided applying empirical partial admission loss models to conventional full-admission computations. This article aims at assessing the reliability of such a loss model under real-gas and supersonic conditions as a first step toward knowledge-based improved loss models. Three different operating points of an 18.3 kW ORC turbine working with an ethanol–water mixture with two open stator passages (2 × 36 deg) are considered. Full-annulus computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computations are compared to experimental data and results of simulations in a conventional, full-admission, periodic 72 deg-sector model with application of a one-dimensional partial admission loss model. The experimentally obtained mass flow rate and efficiency are matched overall within their measurements accuracy. By highest inlet total pressure, the computed efficiency deviates about 4\% from the experiments. Predictions of efficiency based on the full-admission and loss model correction deviate from full-annulus computations less than 1\%. These findings suggest that the used empirical correlations for partial admission losses can provide acceptable results in the configuration under investigation.},
